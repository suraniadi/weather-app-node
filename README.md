# Weather App

Developed as part of Andrew Mead's Node.js [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/) from Udemy.

To power up & start the project you may follow the next steps:

- Make sure you have node installed. Just go to the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer. You can check it afterwards with `$ node -v`
- Clone the repository. `git clone https://github.com/suraniadi/weather-app-node.git`
- Use npm / yarn to install the required packages(For example: `$ npm i` )
- Start the app from the main directory using the dev script: `npm run dev`. The handlebars files will be triggering updates as well.
